# Project Spring Boot - Gemini API

This project illustrates the integration of Google’s Gemini models with Spring Boot through OpenAI-compatible endpoints. This implementation highlights the ease of interfacing with Google's advanced AI models while preserving compatibility with established OpenAI client libraries and development patterns.

Although Google intends to release an official Java SDK for Gemini in the future, this compatibility layer serves as an effective interim solution for Java developers. By making minimal configuration adjustments, developers can seamlessly transition their OpenAI-based applications to leverage Gemini’s sophisticated language models using only an API key. This approach ensures smooth integration while capitalizing on the advanced capabilities of Gemini.
